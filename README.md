The main purpose of a healthcare app is to make healthcare more accessible, convenient, and efficient. They allow patients to do things like book appointments, access their medical records and lab results, get medication reminders, and monitor their health metrics, such as blood pressure and heart rate. For healthcare providers, these apps can streamline administrative tasks, improve communication with patients, and enable remote patient monitoring, which is particularly beneficial for those with chronic conditions or living in rural areas.
